# Digit-Recognition-System
Using 3 models to compare the accuracy for predicting the digits. Used 60,000 samples for training and 10,000 samples for testing on MNIST data set using PYTHON.

Their accuracies are as follows:

1- KNN: The accuracy for K nearest neighbors is 95%.
2- Neural Network: The accuracy for Neural Network is 96.95%.
3- Multinomial Logistic Regression: The accuracy for Multinomial Logistic Regression is 85%.
